# United-Radar-Chart

This project scrapes data from fbref into a pandas dataframe for plotting with matplotlib and an open source library soccerplots. The scraping method is that of a selenium bot that navigates to provided links and scrapes specific winger important data.
I decided to write this after the signing of Jadon Sancho into the Manchester Utd team, people looking to make football charts can work off the scraping method template to create their own data
